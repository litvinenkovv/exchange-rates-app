        Description of the Test Case:
    </h3>
    <p>
        The task is to develop a simple currency converter that makes use of the Fixer.io API to provide
        current conversion rates. The design of the application should be based on the provided example
        image.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Test Case Requirements:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Retrieve Data from the API:</strong> Your application should make a GET request to the Fixer.io API
            to
            retrieve the latest conversion rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> The application should allow users to select their base currency and a
            currency to convert to. It should display the corresponding conversion rate and calculated
            conversion value as the user enters a value.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The application should handle potential errors gracefully. For instance, it
            should display an appropriate message if the API is not available or if the user enters invalid
            input.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> The UI should be intuitive and user-friendly, you can use the below example
            as
            a point of reference and minimal requirement, however if you have some ideas about how to
            improve the UI/UX then by all means do so.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission:</h3>
    <p>
        Please provide the source code for the application, including all necessary files to run the application
        locally, In addition, please provide a brief README describing the application, how to run it, and any
        other important information about your implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a real-world task that will test your ability to develop a functional, user-friendly application with
        real-time data retrieval. We look forward to seeing your creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical
        expertise in action.
